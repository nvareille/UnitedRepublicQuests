Explanations:

Maybe you guys have ever played games on RPG Maker, you know, the most easy Game Making Software that ever existed !

I'm sure everyone here have always wondered about creating a game (Mainly me ok ...), but NOW you have the opportunity to do it !

I with the whole team have thought about a small contest for YOU our Scaly, Feathery and Furry friends ! Let's create a game on this engine !

Here are the goal of the contest:
- Create a Cool Story
- Create a Cool Game
- Create Cool Game Mechanics
- Fun of course !

Here are the rules:
- The RPG Maker version is up to you ! [I never used RPG Maker before ! What RPG Maker should I choose ? Where can I have it ?](https://github.com/nvareille/UnitedRepublicQuests/blob/master/Skrom's%20Little%20Helper%20(First%20Edition)/RPGMaker.md)
- You can team up with people or make the game alone, your preference
- You may only use assets the are given with the engine AND assets that are on the web (You have to keep the source's link, no asset creation please to let an equal chance for everyone)
- No bad stuff about members of the channel (If you want to joke about someone, please ask the Dragon / Gryphon / Girafe / Wolf first)
- It have to include at least 1 of our member in the story (That can of course be you !) 
- Every member that didn't submit something can choose my new place to live :3 (Jury)

Here are my advices:
- It is easier to create a Short awesome game than a long long long (and without content) game
- Iterate ! Start with something and polish in the end ^.=.^
- Do playtests ! Don't choose a member of the jury, that will spoil our pleasure when discovering it
- Ask advices to our community ! What do they like ? What do they do ?
- Think when you are under the shower ... (I really wrote this ? I know I do it but ...)
