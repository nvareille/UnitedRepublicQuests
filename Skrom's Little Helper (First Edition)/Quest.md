Explanations:

Maybe you guys have ever played games on RPG Maker, you know, the most easy Game Making Software that ever existed !

I'm sure everyone here have always wondered about creating a game (Mainly me ok ...), but NOW you have the opportunity to do it !

I with the whole team have thought about a small contest for YOU our Scaly, Feathery and Furry friends ! Let's create a game on this engine !

Here are the goal of the contest:
- Create a Cool Story
- Create a Cool Game
- Create Cool Game Mechanics
- Fun of course !

Here are the rules:
- The RPG Maker version is up to you ! [I never used RPG Maker before ! What RPG Maker should I choose ? Where can I have it ?](https://github.com/nvareille/UnitedRepublicQuests/blob/master/Skrom's%20Little%20Helper%20(First%20Edition)/RPGMaker.md)
- You can team up with people or make the game alone, your preference
- You may only use assets the are given with the engine (This way, everyone have their chances, no cool music Sorry Seledrex and Amyte, nor scripting ;.=.;)
- No bad stuff about members of the channel (If you want to joke about someone, please ask the Dragon / Gryphon / Girafe / Wolf first)
- It have to include at least 1 of our member in the story (That can of course be you !) 
- The Admins and Mods and myself will choose my new place to live :3 (Jury)

Here are my advices:
- It is easier to create a Short awesome game than a long long long (and without content) game
- Iterate ! Start with something and polish in the end ^.=.^
- Do playtests ! Don't choose a member of the jury, that will spoil our pleasure when discovering it
- Ask advices to our community ! What do they like ? What do they do ?
- Think when you are under the shower ... (I really wrote this ? I know I do it but ...)
